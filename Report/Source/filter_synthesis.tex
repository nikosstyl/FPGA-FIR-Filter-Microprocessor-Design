\section{Filter Synthesis}

Once creating every filter with its own configuration, each HDL file has to be synthesized and/or implemented in order to compare each architecture.
For this process, Xilinx Vivado seems to be the best option to use as other great EDA tools like Synopsys and Cadence suites weren't available. Since I'm using Vivado, I should as well target an FPGA that might have access such as the \href{https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-8dyf-11.html}{Zedboard}. Zedboard isn't a very big FPGA in terms of memory size, but, hopefully, it might be able to implement some filters at the end.

\subsection{Importing MATLAB HDL files}
In Vivado, a new project is created for each filter architecture. Files are imported using the standard GUI procedure while also adding constraints for the target device mentioned above.
MATLAB produces source HDL and test-bench for each filter created.
