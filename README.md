# Microprocessor Design Semester Project

For this project, I have to implement an FIR filter with **Fs=4.6 kHz, Fpass=8 kHz and Fstop=9.6 kHz**.

For the above specifications, I have to implement the filter using:

* Minimum order 
* Order = 20 coefficients
* Order = 30 coefficients

**Each order implementation** has to be implemented with:

* Single precision floating point
* Fixed point 24 bits.
* Fixed point 16 bits.
* Fixed point 8 bits.

**Each above architecture** has to be implemented using:

* 1 stage pipelining.
* 2 stage pipelining.
* Multiplierles using CSD.
* Distributed arithmetic.
